                    <h1>The Myth of the Jack of All Trades</h1>
                    <h2 class="post-subtitle">Master of None</h2>
                </header>

                <p>Most people only remember the first half of the quote:</p>
                <blockquote>"Jack of all trades, master of none."</blockquote>
                <p>For years, that line stopped me.</p>

                <p>It made me believe that having interests in Web Development, Immunology, Finance, Worldbuilding, and
                    a dozen other fields meant I lacked focus. That switching between building an app one day and
                    writing sci-fi lore the next made me unserious.</p>

                <p>But then I learned the full quote:</p>
                <blockquote>"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."
                </blockquote>
                <p>And everything changed.</p>

                <h3>Intersections Are Where Innovation Lives</h3>
                <p>The world doesn’t reward narrow boxes anymore.</p>
                <p>It rewards intersections — the places where fields collide and unexpected ideas emerge.</p>

                <p>The evolutionary logic of biology.</p>
                <p>The precision of code.</p>
                <p>The structure of storytelling.</p>
                <p>The leverage loops of finance.</p>

                <p>When you blend these, you stop playing inside one system… and start building your own.</p>
                <p>That’s when the fear dissolves.</p>
                <p>You realize curiosity wasn’t a distraction — it was the compass.</p>

                <h3>The Journey of a Polymath (Or at Least, Someone Trying)</h3>
                <p>This blog isn’t a guru’s podium.</p>
                <p>It’s a documentation of becoming — my attempt to step into polymathy one system, one skill, one
                    curiosity at a time.</p>

                <p>I’m not trying to master isolated fields.<br>I’m trying to understand the threads that tie them
                    together — how technology shapes behavior, how biology shapes systems, how stories shape decisions,
                    how money shapes possibility.</p>

                <p>These aren’t separate interests.<br>They’re one conversation.</p>
                <p>They’re modules — combinable, remixable, evolutionary.</p>
                <p>And as I evolve, this blog will evolve with me.</p>
                <p>The only constant here is curiosity.</p>

                <h3>A Question for You</h3>
                <p>If you’ve ever felt “too scattered,” “too broad,” or “too curious,” you’re not broken — you’re a
                    generalist in a world built by specialists.</p>
                <p>But the future will belong to people who stand at intersections.</p>

                <p>So let me ask you:</p>
                <p><strong>What are you a master of none in?</strong></p>
