                <p>For years, I let the first half of this quote stop me. I thought having interests that spanned from
                    Web Development to Immunology meant I was unfocused. I worried that writing about Financial
                    Independence one day and Sci-Fi Worldbuilding the next would confuse people.</p>

                <p>But then I realized that the most interesting innovations happen at the intersections of these
                    fields. I learned the full quote:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."
                </blockquote>

                <p>This blog is my documentation of that journey. It is a chronicle of my attempt to become a Polymath.
                </p>

                <p>I am not here to be a guru. I am here to explore the systems that run our world. My current
                    investigation weaves together the <strong>Digital</strong> world of code, the
                    <strong>Biological</strong> logic of evolution, the <strong>Narrative</strong> structures of
                    storytelling, and the <strong>Financial</strong> mechanisms of independence.</p>

                <p>But this list is not a boundary. It is just a starting line. As I learn new things, this blog will
                    evolve with me. The only constant is the curiosity.</p>

                <p><em>What are you a "master of none" in? I'd love to hear about your own intersections.</em></p>
